              HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to
              structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be
              structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or
              using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article
              will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.
            </p>
            <h3>So what is HTML?</h2>
              <p>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines
                the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you
                use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way,
                or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to
                somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so
                on. For example, take the following line of content:</p>
              <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
              <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in
                paragraph tags:
              </p>
              <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;
              </code>
          </article>

          <header>HTML element</header>
          <article>
            <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.
            </p>
            <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9347/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="Anatomy of HTML element">
            <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p),
                wrapped in opening and closing <strong>angle brackets</strong>. This states where the element begins or
                starts
                to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
              </li>
              <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a
                forward
                slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where
                the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to
                strange results.
              </li>
              <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
              </li>
              <li><strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag and the content together comprise the
                element.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:
            </p>
            <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9345/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png"
              alt="Elements' attributes">
            <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual
              content.
              Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you
              to
              give the element an identifier that can be used later to target the element with style information and
              other
              things.
            </p>
            <p>An attribute should always have the following:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or
                more
                attributes).
              </li>
              <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
              </li>
              <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="note">Note: Simple attribute values that don't contain ASCII whitespace (or any of the characters
              "
              '
              ` = &lt; &gt;) can remain unquoted, but it is recommended that you quote all attribute values, as it makes
              the
              code more consistent and understandable.

          <header>Nesting elements</header>
          <article>
            <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called <strong>nesting</strong>. If we wanted to
              state that our cat
              is <strong>very</strong> grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a &lt;strong&gt; element, which means
              that
              the word is to be
              strongly emphasized:
            </p>
            <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy&lt;/p&gt;
            </code>
            <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we opened
              the
              &lt;p&gt; element first, then the &lt;strong&gt; element; therefore, we have to close the &lt;strong&gt;
              element first, then the
              &lt;p&gt; element. The following is incorrect:
            </p>
            <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; </code>
            <p>The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another.
              If
              they overlap as shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess at what you were
              trying
              to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!
            </p>

          <header>Empty elements</header>
          <article>
            <p>Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. Take the &lt;img&gt; element that we already
              have in our HTML page:
            </p>
            <code>&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;
            </code>
            <p>This contains two attributes, but there is no closing &lt;/img&gt; tag and no inner content. This is
              because
              an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in
              the
              place it appears.

              at
              how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the code we put into our
              index.html example (which we first met in the <a target="_blank"
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">Dealing

            </p>
            <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html> <br>
              &lt;html> <br>
              &nbsp; &lt;head> <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;meta charset="utf-8"> <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;title>My test page&lt;/title> <br>
              &nbsp; &lt;/head> <br>

              &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"> <br>
              &nbsp; &lt;/body> <br>
              &lt;/html></code>
            <p>Here, we have the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html> — the doctype. It is required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young
                (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow
                to
                be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However
                these
                days, they don't do much, and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly.
                That's
                all you need to know for now.
              </li>
              <li>&lt;html>&lt;/html> — the &lt;html> element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and
                is
                sometimes known as the root element.
              </li>
              <li>&lt;head>&lt;/head> — the &lt;head> element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you
                want
                to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes
                things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our
                content, character set declarations and more.
              </li>
              <li>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"> — This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8
                which
                includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any
                textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this and it can help avoid some
                problems
                later on.
              </li>
              <li>&lt;title>&lt;/title> — the &lt;title> element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title
                that
                appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you
                bookmark/favourite it.
              </li>
              <li>&lt;body>&lt;/body> — the &lt;body> element. This contains all the content that you want to show to
                web
                users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks or
                whatever else.

          <header>Images</header>
          <article>
            <p>Let's turn our attention to the &lt;img> element again:
            </p>
            <code>&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">
            </code>
            <p>As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the src
              (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.
            </p>
            <p>We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In this attribute, you specify descriptive text for
              users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen
                readers to read out the alt text to them.
              </li>
              <li>Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately changing the
                path
                inside your src attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the page, you should see
                something
                like this in place of the image:
              </li>
            </ol>
            <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9349/alt-text-example.png" alt="My test image">
            <p>The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader with
              enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current text of "My
              test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo:
              a
              flaming fox surrounding the Earth."
            </p>
            <p>Try coming up with some better alt text for your image now.

            <h3>Headings</h3>
            <p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings.
              In
              the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML
              contains 6 heading levels, &lt;h1>–&lt;h6>, although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:
            </p>
            <code>&lt;h1>My main title&lt;/h1> <br>
              &lt;h2>My top level heading&lt;/h2> <br>
              &lt;h3>My subheading&lt;/h3> <br>
              &lt;h4>My sub-subheading&lt;/h4></code>
            <p>Now try adding a suitable title to your HTML page just above your &lt;img> element.

            </p>
            <p class="note">Note: You'll see that your heading level 1 has an implicit style. Don't use heading elements
              to
              make text bigger or bold, because they are used for <a

            <h3>Paragraphs
            </h3>
            <p>As explained above, &lt;p> elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently
              when
              marking up regular text content:

            </p>
            <code>&lt;p>This is a single paragraph&lt;/p>

            <h3>Lists</h3>
            <p>A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always
              consist
              of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Unordered lists</strong> are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a
                shopping list. These
                are wrapped in a &lt;ul> element.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Ordered lists</strong> are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a
                recipe.
                These are wrapped
                in an &lt;ol> element.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Each item inside the lists is put inside an &lt;li> (list item) element.

            </p>
            <p>For example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following paragraph fragment into a list

              ...
              &lt;/p>
            </code>
            <p>We could modify the markup to this

            </p>
            <code>&lt;p>At Mozilla, we’re a global community of&lt;/p> <br> <br>

            <p>Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple
              element
              — &lt;a> — "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow
              these
              steps:

            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".
              </li>
              <li>Wrap the text in an &lt;a> element, as shown below: <br>
                <code>&lt;a>Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a>
                </code>
              </li>
              <li>Give the &lt;a> element an href attribute, as shown below: <br>
                <code>&lt;a href="">Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a>
                </code>
              </li>
              <li>Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to link to: <br>
                <code>&lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a>
                </code>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>You might get unexpected results if you omit the https:// or http:// part, called the protocol, at the
              beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you
              wanted
              it
              to.

            </p>
            <p class="note">href might appear like a rather obscure choice for an attribute name at first. If you are
              having
              trouble remembering it, remember that it stands for <b>h</b>ypertext <b>ref</b>erence.

<!--  tasks
User Story #1: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
User Story #2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.
User Story #3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
User Story #4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained 
within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a 
corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java").
User Story #5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
User Story #6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
User Story #7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).
User Story #8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar".
User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
User Story #10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with 
the class main-section.
User Story #11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.
User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you
have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I
click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the 
corresponding header. 
User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and 
should always be visible to the user. 
User Story #15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.
